# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python in
a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to understand the patterns in the data, visualize survival trends,
handle missing values, and generate a cleaned version of the dataset for future use.

Dataset:
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset))

Key Steps
- Loaded and explored raw Titanic dataset  
- Cleaned missing values without dropping any rows  
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Visualized survival trends based on gender, age, class, and fare  
- Plotted correlation heatmaps and violin plots  
- Created interactive Plotly graphs  
- Saved cleaned dataset as `.csv` for downstream tasks


  Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Google Colab

  Conclusion
This EDA project on the Titanic dataset demonstrates how we can extract meaningful insights using
data visualization and preprocessing techniques. By analyzing features such as age, gender, fare, 
and class, we uncover important survival patterns that provide the foundation for future machine 
learning modeling and deeper analysis.
